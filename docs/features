* adding elements to the design
    - a basic library of logic gates
    - inputs, outputs
* adding connections (wires) between elements
* moving elements
    - preserving connections between moved elements
* editing elements
    - number of inputs
* editing connections
* simulation
    - setting and changing input signals
    - displaying the output signals
* add more basic elements
